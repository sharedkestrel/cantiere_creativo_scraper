## What's this

This is a simple python script that parses all the project links on [https://www.cantierecreativo.net/portfolio/](https://www.cantierecreativo.net/portfolio/), then scrapes the project name and the brief description.
The information is then stored in a .csv file, in the format "Name (Description)".

This script uses the libraries BeautifulSoup4 and requests, which can be installed via pip: 
    
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    pip install requests
    
or using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
